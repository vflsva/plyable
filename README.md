# plyable
Plyable is a Python library that creates and transforms triangle meshes with both user-specified and random inputs. Built on top of the mesh-processing library Trimesh (https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh), it operates on the numerical arrays that make up a mesh file, allowing users to push and pull individual vertices and perform other actions not possible in traditional CAD programs. 

The library contains functions that can be used for applications including full-color 3D printing and ideation of generative forms, with possibilities to create models “from scratch” (bypassing CAD entirely). It aims to demystify digital sculpting, and provides novice users with an expressive alternative to modeling software.

Full documentation coming soon.
